        <h1>The reason I chose Computational Media as my major.</h1>
        <p>Starting from my childhood, I was fascinated by the potential of the digital world through various innovative technology at that time such as smartphones, consoles, etc. Over time, I was not satisfied by just enjoying the technologies other people had created; I was also curious to understand how those intriguing technologies were created by digging into the source codes. In the beginning, I had no idea what was involved technically, but when I started to understand those codes line by line after self-studied, I was so encouraged and enlightened.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>At that time, I knew I wanted to be in the area of technology, not only to capture my peculiar thoughts and creative ideas on functions that should be achieved but also to create a more convenient and improving world for others. With a little basic knowledge and a strong belief that I could achieve my goal, I decided to focus my major in computational media.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>Once I started to learn about programming and visual design systematically, I found my creativity is applicable even toward programming since it's not just about coding but also about innovative thinking and creating various algorithms to solve problems. The strong visualizing skills with a partial understanding of the codes of video games also helpd me with problem-solving and to think out of the box efficiently.</p>
